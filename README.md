# Internal Security Auditüõ°Ô∏è
## I will be implementing an internal security audit of a fictional company based on a realistic scenario given by Google's Cybersecurity course. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. My task is to review the IT manager‚Äôs scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
